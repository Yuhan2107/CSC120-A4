- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    Encapsulation is using A class's method at B class when A and B are related. This can help programers to save time since they don't need to write the methods again

    To correctly use those methods from other classes, don't forget to check the availability and signitures of methods. Also, override methods if needed.
